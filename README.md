The Juice Hub is a website that showcase my juice shop's menu and services. It providees detailed information of types of juices and other drinks available, why they are beneficial and a special smoothie prize. <br>
The Juice Hub website target demographic is anyone who prioritises their health, well-being and nutrition. This may include individuals who are fitness enthusiast, those with restricted diets, for example, celiacs or lactose intolerants, as well as those who are looking to incorporate more fruits and vegetables in their day to day life. <br>
The website will be useful to the audience as they can see the menu option which will enhance their experience and complete the survey to win a Smoothie Bowl Kit prize. The transparency will build trust with customers who value transparency and quality. <br>
