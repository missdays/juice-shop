### The Juice Hub website target demographic is anyone who prioritises their health, well-being and nutrition. This may include individuals who are fitness enthusiast, those with restricted diets, for example, celiacs or lactose intolerants, as well as those who are looking to incorporate more fruits and vegetables in their day to day diet. <br>

### The green and orange colour palettes were purposely chosen to evoke feelings of excitement and enthusiasm and create a sense of wellness and health. Orange is associated with warmth, happiness, and creativity, while green is linked to harmony, freshness, and balance. Together, they can create a visually appealing and positive atmosphere that reflects the overall look of a juice shop, making customers feel welcome and inspired. <br>
